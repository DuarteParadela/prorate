# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 2026

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Currency Converter ("we", "our", or "the App") collects, uses, and protects your information.

## 1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT

Currency Converter is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal data to provide you with the best experience:

*   **Analytics Data:** We use PostHog, a privacy-focused analytics service, to collect anonymous usage data such as app opens and feature interactions. This data does not identify you personally and is used solely to improve the App. No personal identifiers are linked to this data.
*   **Purchase Data:** If you make an in-app purchase, we use RevenueCat to process and manage your transaction. RevenueCat may collect purchase history and transaction identifiers as required by Apple. This data is used solely for managing your purchase and is not used for tracking or advertising.
*   **Currency Preferences:** Your selected currencies and preferences are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to our servers.
*   **Exchange Rate Data:** The App fetches exchange rate data from third-party APIs. These requests do not include any personally identifiable information.

## 2. DATA STORAGE

All your settings, preferences, and cached data are stored locally on your device using Apple's standard frameworks. We do not maintain any external databases containing your personal information.

## 3. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

The App uses the following third-party services:

*   **PostHog** — for anonymous usage analytics. PostHog may collect standard technical information (such as IP addresses) as part of normal operations. For more details, see [PostHog's Privacy Policy](https://posthog.com/privacy).
*   **RevenueCat** — for managing in-app purchases. For more details, see [RevenueCat's Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/).
*   **Exchange Rate APIs** — to provide up-to-date currency conversion data. These services may collect standard technical information as part of their normal operations.

## 4. DATA SHARING

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties. We do not share any data with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes. Analytics data collected through PostHog is anonymized and used exclusively for improving the App.

## 5. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

Our App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it immediately.

## 6. DATA SECURITY

We implement appropriate security measures to protect your information. Since all data is stored locally on your device, it benefits from Apple's built-in security features including device encryption.

## 7. YOUR RIGHTS

You can delete all App data at any time by deleting the App from your device. Since we don't collect personal data on our servers, there is no additional data to request or delete.

## 8. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
